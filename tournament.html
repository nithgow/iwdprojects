                    <h3>EsportsTravel Summit 2023</h3>
                    <p>The EsportsTravel Summit is the world’s largest gathering of esports tournament and video-game event organizers and the only event focused on the travel side of the esports industry. Presented by  SportsTravel and hosted by  Greater Raleigh CVB and  Greater Raleigh Sports Alliance, the 2024 EsportsTravel Summit will be held May 29–31, 2024, in Raleigh, North Carolina. Launched in conjunction with the TEAMS Conference & Expo in 2017, the EsportsTravel Summit was an immediate success because it helped fill an information vacuum that exists for organizers of video-game events and those in the travel and tourism industry who want to understand and profit from the esports phenomenon. The biggest brands in the esports world attend the event and their representatives are featured as presenters. The Summit’s unique mission will continue to be education of stakeholders on the nexus between venues, destinations, event suppliers, the travel industry and esports.</p>

                    <h3>CS:GO BLAST Premier: 2023</h3>
                    <p>BLAST has only just begun releasing information about CS:GO BLAST Premier: 2023, so information is still sketchy at the moment. The group rounds of the Spring and Fall seasons are in-studio events, with each being followed by an online Showdown. All finals are being held in arenas.

                        BLAST Premier is a global circuit of events that deliver elite-level Counter-Strike and world-class entertainment for everyone. Assuming the format remains the same as in 2022, twelve of the world’s best eSports teams compete in the Spring and Fall seasons, whittled down to eight for the World Final.</p>
