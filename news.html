                        <h2>Gen.G expands Crocs partnership into Fortnite</h2>
                        <p>The new Crocs World Tycoon game was developed using the Unreal Editor for Fortnite and will launch with a four-week campaign known as ‘Personalise Your Classics.’ Beginning on December 12th, players will participate in challenges where they can win a customised Xbox controller and Crocs footwear.

                            Gen.G has been an esports organisation that has embraced esports-focused metaverse projects in recent years. In September 2022, the organisation first partnered with Crocs to create an activation on the ZEPETO platform. According to a release, Crocs World has seen 5m players playing over the past 15 months.
                            
                            To drive engagement to the arrival of Gen.G and Crocs into Fortnite, the organisation and the brand will utilise several content creators to drive engagement during the campaign.</p>

                        <p>Part of the Dota 2 ESL Pro Tour (EPT), ESL One Birmingham will feature 12 teams. These spots will be taken up by the top four from the EPT leaderboard, with an additional eight qualifying through open and closed qualifiers taking place in January.

                            The 12 teams will be split into two six-team groups. The top four sides from each group will head to the playoffs, taking place in Birmingham’s 15,700-capacity Resorts World Arena. Overall, 22,520 EPT leaderboard ranking points will be awarded throughout the event.
                            
                            In a release, ESL announced the tournament’s theme — Time to Brawl — with the company claiming that it ‘encapsulates Birmingham’s pub culture’ whilst also paying homage to the competition’s previous editions in the city.
                            
                            ESL One Birmingham 2024 will mark the third occasion that ESL has taken Dota 2 to the city; however, this is the first time in several years. Previously holding majors in 2018 and 2019, Birmingham was also set to host a 2020 edition before it was ultimately moved online as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

                        <h2>Automated content platform Allstar secures $12m Series A funding round</h2>
                        <p>Allstar.gg’s platform turns a player’s game data into videos that can be quickly shared across social media platforms. Gamers can customise their clips by adding music, filters, and other video elements without impacting the computer’s performance. This, in theory, should help streamline the video editing process.

                            In addition, Allstar’s solution can convert wide-screen desktop captures into vertical-screen mobile video formats, allowing users to have the recordings ready to be published.
                            
                            It offers four subscriptions: a free version, Pro, Pro Plus, and Platinum. The three purchasable tiers cost respectively $3.19 (~£2.54), $7.99 (~£6.37) and $19.99 (~£15.93) per month.
                            
                            This marks the second round of investment for the company, following the first one completed in April 2021. At the time, Allstar.gg raised $3.9m (~£3.11m) in a seed round, according to online platform Crunchbase.

                        <h2>Rivalry unveils FragFest Counter-Strike 2 LAN event in Toronto</h2>
                        <p>Operated by Rivalry, the FragFest event will take place on January 6th 2024 at the Red Bull Gaming Studio based within Canadian esports holding company OverActive Media’s Toronto headquarters.

                            FragFest will feature 16 teams competing for a share of $2,500 CAD (~£1,467) in prize money. The details of the teams competing were not disclosed.
                            
                            According to a release, the hosting of FragFest is an expansion of Rivalry’s existing partnership with Launders which began in April 2023. The collaboration aims to ‘engage Toronto-based esports fans’ through a range of activations and a range of online content.
                            
                            Throughout 2023, Rivalry has continued to expand its offerings across Canada, where it is based and has a licence to operate. In June 2023, the company launched an esports betting app in Ontario offering markets in various titles including Counter-Strike, League of Legends and Call of Duty.
                            
                            In recent years, bookmakers have increasingly started running their own esports events to engage directly with fans and bettors. Examples include the Pinnacle Cup series, GG.BET’s ‘Match of LeGGends’, the BetBoom Dacha, Thunderpick CS:GO World Championship and Roobet Cup.</p>
